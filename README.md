#### First Java/JS project using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for Epicodus, O6.10.2017

#### By _**{List of contributors}**_

## Description

This website has an index page with vacation information and options.  I've used Javascript and JS on the backend, when clicking on the "Lets Go Vacation" the user will have various vacation choices appear with links to information.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* This should work with the gh-pages provided by GitHub


## Known Bugs

I have had some difficulty with my coding, I have tried to simplify the code in order to make it work and I'm not getting the results I wish to have for the users experience. I am not able to color the entire background, I have tried moving my containers but that created a mess.

## Support and contact details

Should you have any problems feel free to contact me with questions, ideas or concerns. I encourage you to make a contribution to the code.

## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap with some elements copied from Bootstrap on W3 Schools website.  Most of my references were from Google and W3 Schools. This also used Java and JS Query my references include Epicodus, previous projects and Mozilla Developer.
