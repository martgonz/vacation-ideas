#### First Project using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for Epicodus, O5.16.2017

#### By _**{List of contributors}**_

## Description

This website has an index page with Bootstrap using a carousel for images. Click on the tab my profile tab and that will open up a page called profile.html.  I have created a brief profile as to why I am taking the Epicodus class. I've used columns, rows and containers.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* This should work with the gh-pages provided by GitHub


## Known Bugs

I have had some difficulty with the carousel function on the index.html page. This may not load properly at times. Also lining up the images on the profile has been difficult this could be due to conflict between Bootstrap and my CSS styling.

## Support and contact details

Should you have any problems feel free to contact me with questions, ideas or concerns at suerte.0125@gmail.com.  I encourage you to make a contribution to the code. 

## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap with some elements copied from Bootstrap on W3 Schools website.  Most of my references were from Google and W3 Schools.
